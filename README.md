## About
This is an Epicodus project for the JavaScript BDD Assessment.
The project is number to word converter, which does exactly as its name implies: it takes a number in digit form and returns the word form of the number.
For example, if the user input were the number 84, the program would output "eighty four".
This program works for all positive numbers up to 999,999,999,999,999 (i.e. less than 1 quadrillion).
